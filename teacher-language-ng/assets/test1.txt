00:10
How much is fear play into preventing us from grasping perspective, though?
00:15
Oh no!
00:16
Fear is everything.
00:17
Yeah, like if there is if there was one concept that I would suggest to people to take a daily
00:28
confrontation with, it’s fear.
00:33
The problem with fear is that it lies, right.
00:37
So, fear tells you, "Hey, you know, if you say that to that girl she's going to know
00:44
she has you, you know, and she'll never really be attracted to you if she knows how much
00:50
you attracted to her.
00:52
Don't say that, no!
00:53
How we get her is when she walks by, ignore her."
00:58
You know, fear tells you dumb shit like that.
01:05
Okay, you know.
01:08
So, for me, the daily confrontation with fear has become a real practice for me since about
01:15
three years ago.
01:19
I went skydiving in Dubai, right!
01:21
As skydiving, skydiving is a really interesting confront with fear, right.
01:28
So, I got to stand up.
01:31
So, all your friends…
01:34
What happens you go out, how you…
01:36
Oh sorry, drop my thing…
01:37
So, what happens is you go out the night before and you-you know.
01:41
You take a drink with your friends and somebody says, "Yeah!
01:44
We should go skydiving tomorrow."
01:47
And you go, "Yeah, we'll go skydiving tomorrow."
01:49
Yeah, yeah!
01:51
Yeah, right?
01:53
And you go home by yourself, you like, “hmm…”
01:55
You like, "Well, yeah."
01:58
I mean, they were drunk too, right?
02:03
So, maybe they not, maybe-maybe, I mean.
02:05
We don't have to go.
02:07
We don’t have to do it.
02:08
So then, that night you're laying in your bed and you just keep “hmm”
02:12
And you're terrified.
02:14
You keep imagining over and over again jumping out of an airplane, and you can't figure out
02:19
why you would do that, right!
02:21
And you're laying there you have the worst night's sleep of your life but you still have
02:25
the hope that your friends were drunk, right.
02:27
So, you wake up the next day.
02:29
You go, you know, down.
02:31
You say where you were going to meet and everybody's there.
02:33
You're like, "Oh shit!"
02:35
Alright, alright.
02:36
Cool, cool, cool, cool, right!
02:39
So, you get in the van and you don't know that your friends have the same night that
02:44
you had cuz they're pretended like they didn't it.
02:46
Like, "Yeah, man!
02:47
My uncle's a Navy SEAL and, you know, this is going to be great.
02:50
I've been looking forward to this."
02:51
You like, "Oh my god!
02:52
Oh my god!"
02:53
And your stomach is terrible.
02:55
You can't eat and everything but you don't want to be the only funk who doesn't jump
03:00
out of this airplane.
03:01
So, you get there and then you have the safety brief.
03:05
And you're standing there and the guys will tell you what the chute doesn't open what's
03:07
going to happen is, you're doing…
03:10
What…Would…What could happen?
03:12
The chute, the chute would open, right?
03:14
So, you do a thing and what you do is your first jump you're attached to a guy who is
03:19
going, you know, he's going to walk you out.
03:20
So, you go and you get there, and there's an airplane and nobody's stopping.
03:26
Everybody's still going.
03:27
So, you get onto the airplane and you're sitting there, and, you know, it's extra because you're
03:31
sitting on some dude’s lap, some stranger you sit on his lap.
03:36
And it's all you know.
03:37
You got trying to make small talk, "Yeah man!"
03:41
So, you-you've been jumping with people all the time.
03:44
Right.
03:45
You know.
03:46
So, and then you just want to make sure, "You got, you got kids, right?
03:49
You got people you need to see, right?"
03:51
Just want to make sure he's serious, right.
03:53
So, you get in there.
03:54
So, everything's normal.
03:55
So, you fly and you go up, you go up, you go up, you go up to 14,000 feet, and you notice
04:00
there's a light: It's red, and it's yellow and green.
04:05
Right.
04:06
So right now, the lights red.
04:07
So, then you start thinking at some point the lights going to go green because you don't
04:10
know what's going to happen, right.
04:13
And you wait, and it goes yellow, and the light goes green, and somebody opens the door
04:17
and at that moment, you realize you've never been in a freaking airplane with the door
04:22
open.
04:23
Right!
04:24
Terror!!!
04:25
Oh sorry, I spit…
04:28
Oh sorry…
04:29
Terror!
04:30
Terror!
04:31
Terror!
04:32
Terror!
04:33
Right!
04:34
So, you go and then, you know, if you're, if you were smart you sat in the back, so
04:40
you don't go first, right.
04:42
And then, people start going out of the airplane, and you go, and the guy walks you up to the
04:48
end of the thing and you're standing and your toes are on the edge, and you're looking out
04:55
down to death.
04:59
And they say, "On three!"
05:01
And they say, “One, two…”
05:03
And he pushes you on two because people grab on three, right.
05:11
And you go…
05:14
And you fall out of the airplane and in one second you realize that it's the most blissful
05:22
experience of your life.
05:25
You're flying, right.
05:27
It doesn't feel like falling, right.
05:29
It's like that you, actually, are kind of held a little bit by the wind and then, you
05:33
start, and you start falling, you falling, and you, there's
05:36
zero fear.
05:38
You realize that the point of maximum danger is the point of minimum fear.
05:45
It's bliss!
05:46
It's bliss!
05:47
And you're flying….
05:49
And you're doing it...
05:53
And then 20 seconds, 25 seconds, 40 seconds, and you have enough time to just kind of like,
06:00
"Ah!
06:01
That's that building I saw that morning…Oh, I can see the ocean…"
06:06
Right?
06:07
You start doing all of that, and the lesson for me was: Why were you scared in your bed
06:12
the night before Why did you…what do you need that fear for?
06:17
Just don't go!
06:18
Why are you scared in your bed 16 hours before?
06:22
You jump?
06:23
Why are you scared in the car?
06:25
Why could you not enjoy breakfast?
06:27
What would…What would you need that?
06:30
Fear is…Fear of what?
06:32
You’re now where to even near to the airplane.
06:35
Everything is up to the stepping out.
06:38
There's actually no reason to be scared!
06:41
It only just ruins your day.
06:44
You don't have to jump.
06:46
And then, at that moment all of a sudden where you should be terrified is the most blissful
06:51
experience of your life, and God placed the best things in life on the other side of Terror.
06:59
On the other side of your maximum fear or all of the best things in life.
07:03
You know, so that was…oh, sorry.
07:06
So, that was, yeah, that was, that was my experience with skydiving and fear.
07:11
All right, all right.
07:12
So, practically speaking…
07:13
But, I didn't like that take, I'm gonna do it again.
07:16
Back to the top.
07:18
I can sell that better.
07:19
I can sell that better.
07:21
When did you decide to do something like that?
07:24
Like, how does it work practically?
07:25
Do you call your wife and be like, "I might be dead tomorrow."
07:28
Right.
07:29
No, but that's what…
07:30
I never…
07:31
Just promise…
07:32
Yeah, I made a drunk promise, yeah.
07:33
How about this, so I jumped I had such a mystical powerful spiritual experience I flew home
07:40
and got my sons, and I went back and ten days later my son's jumped.
07:48
Right.
07:49
Now, that was a little different… …that makes me spit…
07:52
Because I'm scared I'm scared, right.
07:54
So, it was one…So, Jayden went first, right.
07:58
Jayden wants to do everything first.
07:59
So, I'm sitting there and I'm like, "Yeah, my sons are going to have this crazy experience."
08:03
And then Jayden went out of the airplane, I was like, “hmm…”
08:09
Then my oldest son Trey goes up and he goes out of the airplane, and I was like, "This
08:14
could potentially be the worst display of African-American parenting in history".
08:19
I was like, both my sons just fell out of an airplane.
08:26
Jump…jump, right!
08:28
Because I told them to and that…but again the fear again.
08:30
I was like, "Oh my god".
08:32
So, I told the dude.
08:33
I was like, "Listen!
08:34
I want to see them go out but I also want to see them land."
08:37
And he's like, "No, it’s cool".
08:39
So, this time we went out and we did the straight bullet.
08:42
And I just went straight down, past them, right.
08:48
Are you good?
08:52
Right.
08:54
Did the bullet straight past, pull the chute late…Oh, sorry.
08:57
It makes me spit…
08:58
I'm sorry.
08:59
I'm sorry.
09:00
Pulled the chute late, landed and then video them coming down.
09:04
But it was like, they had the same thing, the same experience with the fear but that
09:08
I'm telling you the confrontation with fear is an absolutely magical way of facing the
09:15
things we have to do in this life.
09:17
You know, forget security live for experience.
09:20
So, with that, every morning when I get out of the bed, you know, I haven't fixed everything
09:28
in the world yet so there's always something to do, and in this film, I read an interesting
09:33
quote…the Siddhārtha Gautama, the Buddha, he said that "Good people have to get out
09:44
of the bed every day and try to empty the ocean with a ladle".
09:51
Right.
09:52
And I thought that was, you know, I knew that was profound and I paused for a second, and
09:56
I said, "All right, what the hell is a ladle?
09:59
Right?
10:00
Right?
10:01
So there, you know, I just…I touched it on my iPad, what’s ladle?
10:03
Oh!
10:04
It's like a big spoon…a big spoon, okay.
10:06
Like a soup spoon, yeah.
10:09
A soup spoon.
10:10
I was like, "Why your soup spoon".
10:11
So, trying to empty the ocean with a soup spoon, you know, as the mentality of how you
10:17
wake up every day to try to do good in the world.
10:20
So, for me I'm…uh…I'm really driven by continually trying to elevate my, elevate
10:30
my mind and elevate my spirit, and care for my body and to be able to love as many people
10:37
as effectively as possible with this mystery of life that I've been given.

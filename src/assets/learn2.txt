You're learning with 925 English - business English for the workplace!
00:14
Hi Tim here with another 925 english lesson. In today's lesson we're going to
00:23
learn how to talk about the work you do in your job. Last time we looked at how
00:30
to talk about your job, which might include stating your position and
00:36
company and what you are responsible for, But what if someone wants to know more
00:43
about what you actually do? For example someone might ask what your daily
00:50
routine is like or they might ask about your current or past projects. How can
00:57
you describe these kinds of activities?
01:00
Well let's start with talking about your current work or projects by current. I
01:09
mean things that are happening now. When we talk about things happening right now,
01:15
we normally say we are "doing" something. You might use "we" if you mean your
01:24
company or team is working on something or you might use "I" if you are talking
01:31
about just what you are doing.
01:35
Let's practice some examples of talking about your current work in this way.
01:40
Listen to each example then repeated yourself. Ready? Let's get started.
01:49
We're busy designing a new housing development in California.
01:59
Right now, we're doing a big website project.
02:08
We're getting ready for a trade show.
02:15
At the moment, I'm overseeing the installation of a new machine.
02:26
That's not too hard, right? And you'll notice that it's always good to use
02:33
strong or specific verbs such as "design" and "oversee" when you talk about what you're doing.
02:42
Now what if someone asks you about what you've done in the past?
02:48
Well to talk about your past work, it's still a good idea to choose a strong
02:54
verb.
02:56
Just remember to put it in the past tense. But you don't need to say "was
03:03
doing." You can just use the simple form "did" because it's completed.
03:10
Let's try a little practice talking about your past work. Just like last time
03:16
I want you to repeat the examples after you hear them.
03:23
I chaired the fundraising committee last year.
03:30
I led the company's annual audit.
03:37
My colleagues and I designed the new elementary school in clifton.
03:47
I used to work on site as an engineer but now I've moved into management.
03:59
One really useful expression you might have noticed is "used to."
04:06
When there's an activity in the past that you did many times or was ongoing
04:12
you can say you "used to" do it.
04:17
Now what if someone wants to know your current routine.
04:22
I mean how you usually spend your time during your workday.
04:27
Well you can certainly use that exact expression i just used. You can say you
04:34
"spend" your time doing something or you can say your work "involves" some type of
04:42
activity. And when you mentioned the activity use the "-ing" form like "I spend a
04:51
lot of time writing reports."
04:56
Let's practice talking about your daily routine with a few examples.
05:02
Once again, repeat what you hear.
05:06
I spend a lot of time answering the phone and emails.
05:15
My work involves talking with customers and solving technical problems.
05:25
I put in a lot of time visiting customers every day.
05:34
Most of my day is spent calling clients and handling orders.
05:45
So that's how we talk about our daily routines but how might this sound in a
05:52
real-life conversation? Let's listen to a short conversation between two people
05:58
who have just met. The first person is asking the other person, John, about his
06:06
work. Listen to how John answers the questions.
06:11
So do you guys have any new projects on
06:15
at the moment?
06:16
Actually, we've just started work on a new factory.
06:20
You must be busy what's your day-to-day routine like?
06:25
Most of my day is spent testing new machines and checking on deliveries.
06:31
Can you hear how this works? John is asked about new project, so he mentioned
06:38
something his company has just started and when he is asked about his
06:44
day-to-day routine he explains how his day is spent. And notice those verbs
06:51
"testing" and "checking on." Now it's your turn to practice. We'll repeat the
06:59
dialogue but this time we're going to beep out the second speakers words. You will
07:06
have to say those parts yourself. Remember to start by mentioning your
07:12
current work then you'll talk about your daily routine.
07:20
So do you guys have any new projects on at the moment?
07:30
You must be busy! What's your day-to-day routine like?
07:42
So now you've practiced talking about your work. But another part of talking
07:48
about your job, involves talking about your company. You'll have to tune in to
07:54
our next lesson to learn how to do that. Until then, so long and happy learning!

60:27
The driver learned his lesson he will never drive in the wind again
60:35

She looked at the screen
98:32
Give me three cherries. She thought or
98:37
Give me three bananas, or give me three apples

161:23
Betty met Paul after she broke her leg
161:27

Betty told her mom
161:55
But it was the best thing that ever happened to you
161:59
Life is strange sometimes her mom said
162:04

162:12
Restaurants they went to the beach
162:15
They even went skiing
162:18
They were so happy together
162:21
One day Paul asked Betty to marry him
162:26
Can we have lots of kids she?
162:29
asked of
162:31

162:32
he said
162:34
But let me teach them how to ski they both laughed
162:39
Do you have salted peanuts Joe asked? Yes, we do
162:47
said the store manager
162:50
there at the end of aisle four
162:53
They are next to the potato chips. You can't miss them
162:58
Joe thanked the manager he pushed his shopping cart down aisle four
163:05
He saw some jars of pickles
163:08
Pickles would taste good with a ham sandwich
163:12

163:53
All the bags were the same price
163:57
He put a bag of salted peanuts in his cart
164:02
Salted peanuts are not as healthy as unsalted peanuts
164:08
But salted peanuts tastes a lot better
164:13

164:55
am afraid of going on boats I
164:58
am afraid of flying in planes over the ocean I
165:03
Want to learn how to swim?
165:06
You don't need to learn how to swim her husband said all you need to learn is how to float?
165:15
Floating is so easy
165:17
It's especially easy for women because women have more fat than men
165:24
Let me give you a quick lesson

Spread your arms and legs
165:37
Breathe normally, that's it
165:41
Yes, that sounds easy. She said, but I want to learn how to swim
165:48
Swimming is good exercise
165:51
Swimming will help me lose weight
165:54
Floating will not help me lose weight if
165:58
I float for a day. I won't lose any weight at all
166:04
Ok he said, I will teach you how to swim this weekend

177:34
He had a cell phone
177:36
He dialed 9-1-1
177:39
His cell phone did not work in the mountains
177:43
He said he would get help
177:46
He ran back down the trail
177:49
Donna was afraid to stay in the mountains
177:53
So was Linda
177:55
They got up and slowly walked down the trail
178:00
They held hands
178:02
They did not say a word
178:05
They kept looking around and behind them. They were so afraid
178:11
They jumped when they heard a strange sound
178:15
Was the mountain lion following them the man set the woman on fire?
178:22
She was a dancer in a nightclub
178:25
The man came to the nightclub once a month
178:29
He asked the woman for her phone number
178:32
She said no. I don't even know you she said why would I give you my phone number?
178:39
He told her that he was in love with her
178:43
She told him that he was crazy
178:46
How could he be in love with her? He didn't even know her
178:52
He didn't know anything about her
178:56
He finished his drink and paid for it
179:00
He left the nightclub
179:02
He sat in his car in the parking. Lot she
179:06
Was glad that he left
179:09
Later she went outside to smoke a cigarette
179:14
The man got out of his car
179:17
She did not see him or hear him
179:21
He poured gasoline on her and threw a match on her
179:26
She was on fire
179:29
She started screaming
179:31
She ran into the nightclub
179:34
The manager put the fire out with his jacket, but her face and hands were badly burnt
179:42
No one would ever ask her for her phone number again
179:47
George owned a house near the woods
179:50
He had three neighbors. They all had big beautiful houses
179:57
They loved their small neighborhood because it was near the woods
180:02
It was not near traffic noise or the city
180:08
Many birds and other animals lived in the woods
180:13
one day
180:14
George drove home in a water truck a
180:18
Water truck holds a lot of water
180:22
George thought the water truck would save the houses from fires
180:27
the water truck held
180:29
2,000 gallons of water
180:32
it cost
180:34
$50,000
180:36
That's a lot of money
180:38
But if it saves our homes from a fire it's worth every penny
180:44
He told his neighbors
180:46
They all agreed with him
180:49
One year later the woods were on fire
180:53
George sprayed water on all the houses they could not catch on fire because they were so wet
181:02
George saved all the houses with his water truck his neighbor said he was brave
181:10
They thanked him for saving their homes
181:14
They had a big party for George
181:17
They gave him a red fireman
